The thermodynamic stability change upon mutation is measured by ΔΔG(T$_{r}$), i.e. the difference between the standard Gibbs folding free energies of the mutant (ΔG$^{mut}$) and wild-type (ΔG$^{wild}$) proteins at the reference temperature T$_{r}$:\n\n$$  ΔΔG(T_{r}) = (ΔG^{mut})(T_{r}) - (ΔG^{wild})(T_{r}) $$\n\nIn general,\n\n$$ G = Enthalpy \\ \\  (H) - Temperature \\ \\ (T) \\ x \\ Entropy \\ \\ (S)  $$\n\nH is the internal energy of a protein. H decreases during protein folding because folding will cause packing of hydrophobics, optimized polar group orientation, and achieves a good proximity to ideal bond lengths and angles. S is the measure of order within a system. S of a protein becomes lower during protein folding because residue dynamics will be significantly decreased in comparison the unfolded state. However, decrease is in protein S will also cause an increase in S for solvent. The energy of an unfolded protein is nearly identical with a single point mutation. So, the\ndominant factor in DDG is the energy difference of the folded state.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"DDG results will fall into three categories:\n\n1. **DDG > 0.5**: Positive results suggest that a mutation would be destabilizing. Most mutations will be positive or close to zero because proteins have evolved to be reasonably stable. These mutations are residues that you should usually avoid during design.\n\n2. Things that are near 0 are within the noise range so should be considered neutral.\n\n3. DDG < -0.5: Negative results suggest that the mutation would lead to a more stable protein. However, the environment at each position should be considered.\n\n    a. If interacting molecules are not present in the model, such as at a known zinc binding site, then a seemingly favorable mutation will not be favorable in reality.\n    \n    b. A positions that has a lot of negative DDGs could mean that this position evolved a destabilizing residue because it is necessary for its catalytic activity, for binding another molecule, or because of another functionally relevant reason.\n    \n    c. Also, consider that this measures a single point mutation. Many times it requires multiple interacting mutations in order to achieve significant stability.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# ESM-2\n\nESM-2 is a transformer-based language model, and uses an attention mechanism to learn interaction patterns between pairs of amino acids in the input sequence.\n\nThe larger the value of the attention, the more impactful would be any mutation at that location.
