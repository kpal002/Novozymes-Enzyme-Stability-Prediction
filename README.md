# Novozymes-Enzyme-Stability-Prediction
[Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction) and Course project CS234 (Computational Methods for the Analysis of Biomolecular Data)

The goal of the competition is to predict the thermostability of enzyme variants. The experimentally measured thermostability (melting temperature) data includes natural sequences, as well as engineered sequences with single or multiple mutations upon the natural sequences.
